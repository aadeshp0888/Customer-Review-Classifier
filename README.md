Developed an NLP-based web application to automatically detect and classify bad customer reviews
for hotels, enabling businesses to quickly identify and address negative feedback.

Python with Flask for the web interface, NLTK and scikit-learn for NLP and ML, pandas for data,
gensim (if Doc2Vec is used), and pickle for model persistence.
